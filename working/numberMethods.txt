Number Methods & Properties


Properties: These are properties of the Number object, so you can access them straight on Number rather than on numbers created via the Number object.

Number.MAX_VALUE: represents the maximum numeric value representable in JavaScript, which is 1.79E+308. Values larger than MAX_VALUE are represented as "Infinity".

Number.MIN_VALUE: represents the smallest positive numeric value representable in JavaScript, which is 5e-324. Values smaller than MIN_VALUE ("underflow values") are converted to 0.

Number.NaN: represents Not-A-Number. Equivalent of NaN. Interesting that NaN is actually a number.
