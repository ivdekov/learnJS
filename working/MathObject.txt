Math Object - 
As we delve into javascript further it is important to understand MATH. MATH is a native javascript object that encompasses methods to perform on both integers and floats. 

As you might assume, the math method performs mathematical tasks on numbers. These methods are useful in modifying numbers and providing dynamic data to your audience. Below i will provide a list of examples for useful methods associated with the math object. Keep in mind MATH is an incredibly vast topic and the object itself contains a plethora of methods encompassing a large area within the field. I will focus this lesson on ones that have real world properties.

Math.random() - provides a random number between 0 and 1

Math.round(),
Math.ceil(),
Math.floor() - Three rounding methods that are used to round floats to integers 

Math.min(),
Math.max() - provides the largest and smallest numbers respectively.

Math.pow(x,y) - returns the value of x to the power of y. Math.pow(10,2) = 100.

Along with these dynamic methods (require input from your program in the form of data), there are also a variety of constants that allow your program to act as a calculator:

Math.PI - returns PI (3.14....)

Math.SQRT_2,
Math.SQRT1_2 - Returns the square roots of 2 and 1/2 respectively

Math.LN10 - returns the natural log of 10.

Feel free to delve into these methods. Math is a incredibly useful object in javascript and knowledge of these methods can make life easier when presenting numbers.
