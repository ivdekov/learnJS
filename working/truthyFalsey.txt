Truthy vs Falsey

If you have read enough about javaScript you will have heard about Truthy and Falsey. Both of these values are important and used to evaluate expressions to both True and False.  

Here are the five false values in javascript:
“ “ - an empty string
undefined - a variable without a value associated with it
null - an empty value
Nan - not a number
false - of course!

The truthy vs falsey conundrum is actually simple and something you have used in code from the very beginning. When using conditionals and booleans, more often then not you create an expression that is only executed if the value is true.

While subconsciously using Truthy and Falsey statements throughout your code it is important to understand the Falsey values as your write you code.
