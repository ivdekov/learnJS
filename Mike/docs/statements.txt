Javascript Statements (go indepth for each type)

The majority of code you write in javascript or any other language for that matter is in the form of statements. And while statements are uniform to prgramming, it is important to understand how they are written using javascript.

So what is a statement?
Esentially statements are instructions sent through javascript to executed by the browser. Without these statements, we do not have the ability to create dynamic code that builds and solves problems in the browser. While everyone knows an "if" statement and how to use a "for" loop, there are 11 statements used in javascript, many of which are rarely used by the masses. While some of these statements can be considered obscure, it is important to understand them as there is a tool for every trade.

statements (according to W3):
break - 	    Terminates a switch or a loop
continue - 	    Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top
debugger - 	    Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function  
do ... while - 	Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true
for	-           Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true
function -   	Declares a function
if ... else	-   Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition
return	-       Exits a function
switch	-       Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases
try ... catch - Implements error handling to a block of statements
var	Declares a variable  

Over the next few days we will go through each of these statement types and provide examples to complement them.
