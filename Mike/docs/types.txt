Types - representations for values. (do in depth desc. on each type)

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable can hold any type of value at any time, vs statically typed, where the variable must be enforced with a type at creation, such as a string or number. Changes between types is known as coercion.

	ex. var number = 10 // number is of the type number
		number = ’10’ // number has been coerced and is now of the type string
	// note that when using operands sometimes coercion happens automatically
	


String - simply a way to represent text. values are surrounded with either single or double quotes, as per your preference.
	The preferred way of creating strings is with a literal representation
	var myString = “Isn’t this cool!”;

	Alternatively you could do it this way, but it is not preferred.
	var myString = new String(“This is not quite as cool.”);

	You can coerce something to a string like with the following syntax: 
	var num = 5; // type number
	num = String(num); // type string
	
	You could also use the method num.toString();

caveats:

var num = 5
    , str    = ‘5’;

if ( num == str ) console.log(‘true’) // true
else console.log(‘false’)

if ( num === str ) console.log(‘true’)
else console.log(‘false’) // false

num + str = ’55'
