For the first part in our 10 part series on Statements, we will go in depth into the If...Else statement. "If" statements have been apart of programming since the beginning. They provide a means of easily looping through pieces of data and adding logic to your code.

If statements have flexibility in the code that you write:

a) "if" statements can execute if the condition is true:
			var x = 3;
			if ( x===3) {
			alert("do_something")
			}

b)    "if...else" can execute a statement if a condition is true or execute a statement
			var x = 5;
			if (x===3){
			alert("do_something")
			}
			else {
			alert("do_something_else")
			}
c)    "if...else if....else" If statments can start to get complex with the introduction of "else if". With "else if" (just like "if"), a statement is run if the condition is true.
			var x = 4;
			if (x===3) {
			alert("do_something")
			}
			else if (x===4){
			alert("success!")
			}
			else {
			alert("i_will_run_if_the_above_statements_are_false")
			}


If statements are incredibly important to the success of developers and if you want to run a block of code only under certain conditions if statements are a good choice.
