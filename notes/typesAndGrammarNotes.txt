TYPES
----------


For our purposes, a type is a set of characteristics that identifies the behavior of a particular value, allowing it to be distinguished from other values, the engine, and the developer.

There is larger discussion on this, but it is mostly irrelevant to us and not worth arguing. What is important is knowing that there is an intentional behavior made by both the engine and the developer based on the type.

7 types:
  null
  undefined
  boolean
  number
  string
  object
  symbol (ES6)

typeof operator will return a string of the type

We are going to focus on some of these, including the subtypes of object, object, array, and function.

VARIABLES DON'T HAVE TYPES. VALUES DO.

  This might seems like semantics. typeof is not asking the type of a variable, but the typeof of the value inside the variable.

Arrays

Basically just a container for any type. SAVE ARRAYS FOR NUMERICALLY INDEXED POSITIONS.


Strings

JS strings are immutable, and because of this the methods that alter strings must return a new value.


How to reverse a string (common interview question). Since a string is immutable we can't share all the methods available from an array, even though they are similar.

// this is a hack. convert string to array. str.split('')
// reverse with array.reverse(). convert back to string. array.join('')
// will only work with basic strings, nothing complex like unicode, etc.
// If it seems the common tasks you are doing on strings is array methods
// it may make sense to store as array and convert to string by array.join('') when necessary

// hack example
var str = 'hello there'
var strReverse = str.split('').reverse().join('')
str // 'hello there'
strReverse // 'ereht olleh'
